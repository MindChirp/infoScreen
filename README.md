# infoScreen

This is an info screen program. It is suppposed to be a part of a slew of different products, all connected to each other. This desktop program is eventually going to have a web-based version, which is not going to be as powerful, but will still be able to do different useful things.

# Architecture

The program connects to a server, either a local one, or the official server. Through this, you can edit the content of the slideshows, and display it through another computer connected to the server through a web browser (prefferably Google Chrome)
