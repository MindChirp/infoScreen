    <h1>Polishing Update</h1>
    <div style="background-color: var(--secondary-button-color); padding: 1rem; box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 2rem; width: calc(100% - 4rem); border-radius: 0.5rem;">
    <h3 style="margin: 0; width: fit-content;">
        This new update polishes the overall feel of the program. Updating to the newest version has been made easier, and the notifications have gotten an overhaul.

        <br><br>
        The profile picture button will now indicate more clearly what it does when you press it, so that confusion should never arise as to how to sign in, or how to access the user settings. 

        <br><br>
        Window handling has been revamped, so that alt+f4 is handled gracefully. Exiting the main program should now also close the experimental 'fullscreen view' automatically. <br>
        When closing the main window, a modal window will now appear if a user has chosen to not stay signed in. This window will warn the user that the client automatically will be signed out if it is closed. 

        <br><br>
        There are also other small changes, for instance to the viewport rendering. The progress widget has been changed to display the content relative to its size. This also goes for the text widget.

        <br><br>
        The fullscreen view button has been moved to the experimental features category, which means that it can only be accessed if the 'experimental features' setting is enabled.
